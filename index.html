Run and Manage Containers
Task 1.

    Configure Podman to search the registry registry-1:5000 last.

    Configure the registry as an insecure registry.

Task 2.

    Pull the latest Nginx image docker.io/library/nginx.

    Start a container using the Nginx image with the following:

        Name = web-vol

        Mount local directory /home/cloud_user/web to container as /usr/share/nginx/html

        Run the container in the pod named task-2 by using the podman option --pod task-2

    Verify you can access the web page by using curl localhost:8081.

    Save a copy of the container logs to a file named web-vol.log.

Task 3.

    Pull the latest MySQL image docker.io/library/mysql.

    Start a container using the MySQL image with the following:

        name=mysql-llama

        MYSQL_PASSWORD=badpass

        MYSQL_USER=guru

        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=supersecret

        Publish port 3306 on the container to port 3306 on the localhost

    Verify the MySQL instance is running with the following command, and check that the llama database is there:

        echo "show databases;" | mysql -uguru -pbadpass --protocol tcp -h localhost

    Make a directory named mysql_logs and copy the log file /var/lib/mysql/mysql/general_log_213.sdi to the directory.

Task 4.

    Start a Nginx container from registry-1:5000 using a tag that is NOT latest. Use the following parameters:

        name=web-default

        Publish port 80 in the container to localhost port 8080

    Verify you can access the web page with curl localhost:8080.

    Start a Bash shell on the container and modify /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html in the container, then change the current message to A guru was here!.

    Verify you can access the web page with curl localhost:8080 and see your new message.

    Commit the modified container to a new image named registry-1:5000/nginx:web-guru.





Build and Run Custom Images
Task 5.

    Push your new image to registry-1:5000.

    Stop the container web-default and start a new container using your new image. Use the following parameters: - name=web-guru - Publish port 80 in the container to localhost port 8080

    Verify you get your custom message with curl localhost:8080.

    Save your new image as a tar file named guru-web.tar.

Task 6.

    Complete the incomplete Dockerfile located at /home/cloud_user/docker/Dockerfile. Details are listed in the incomplete Dockerfile.

Task 7.

    Build an image from the completed Dockerfile in task 6. The image should be built with the following:

        name=llama-cart

        tag=v1

    Start a container with the new image using the following settings:

        name=llama=web

        Publish port 90 in the container to localhost port 8090

    Verify the image works by putting your lab-system-name:8090 or IP-Address:8090 into a web browser.

        Alternatively, use curl localhost:8090 and see just the text version of the page.
